> PHP ignorant markdown parser

This is a fun project, and it is a work in progress. Do not use it for anything other than laughing at my bad code.


1. Goals & Why
----------------------------------------

### 1.1 Why

- I couldn't find a proper markdown parser in PHP, with readable & maintainable code
- Most markdown parsers i find use lots and lots of regular expressions, and although i love regex, i don't think that's the ultimate way to go for parsing a reasonably complex text format.

### 1.2 Goals

- Make it work
- Have readable maintainable code (& tests)
- Use as little regular expressions as possible


2. Getting started
----------------------------------------

don't.
